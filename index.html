			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Jack Hanford and I am not your average 19 year old. I grew up in Leland, a small town in Northern Michigan, while attending an even smaller school (14 kids in my graduating class.) I graduated in June 2012 one week later I was 2500 miles from home with no friends and no family.</p>
			<p>Nervous but excited, I found myself in Palo Alto, CA. I was in technology capital of the world. My life was about to change faster then I think I could have ever predicted. I would love to talk about what I am working on and probably don't have enough space to fill you in about it here but you can read about some of my adventures <a href="http://stuvoice.org/blog/2012/08/09/jack-hanford-recent-high-school-graduate-not-taking-traditional-college-route-california/">here</a> or just get in touch with me above.</p>
