			<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
			<p>My name is Jack Hanford and I am not your average 19 year old. I grew up in Leland, a small town in Northern Michigan while attending an even smaller school (14 kids in my graduating class.) I graduated in June 2012 one week later I was 2500 miles from home with no friends and no family.</p>

			 <p>I was in San Francisco, the technology capital of the world. My life was about to change faster then I could have ever predicted. I love to talk about my home town and probably don't have enough space to fill you in about it here but you can read about some of my adventures <a href="http://www.stuvoice.org/2012/08/09/jack-hanford-recent-high-school-graduate-not-taking-traditional-college-route-california/">here</a> or just get in touch with me to the right.</p>

			<h3><strong>Hobbies</strong></h3>
			<ul class="square">
				<li><strong>Build</strong>: Although I am relatively new to programming, I still love to test my abilities to see what I can do. Right now I am building a few new fun projects and trying to beef up my abilities to hopefully be able to push to production at a company I love.</li>
				<li><strong>Bike</strong>: I try to bike atleast 10 miles a day. I found the best way for me to blow off steam is to fly down a mountain on my road bike. Adrenaline and the beautiful weather in California are a perfect mix.</li>
				<li><strong>Surround</strong>: One year in Silicon Valley has connected me with some of the most fascinating people I have ever met. I am not used to networking but that isn't keeping me from trying my best to master the skill.</li>
				<li><strong>Read</strong>: In high school I thought I hated reading. I was wrong, it wasn't a problem of hating reading it was a problem of hating the content. I often find myself reading the latest news on technology blogs for hours on end. The best feeling in the world is when they are writing about you or your current project.</li>
