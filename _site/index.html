      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Jack Hanford and I am not your average 20 year old. I grew up in Leland, a small town in Northern Michigan, while attending an even smaller school (there were only 14 kids in my graduating class.) I graduated in June 2012 one week later I was 2500 miles from home with no friends and no family.</p>
      <p>Nervous but excited, I found myself in Palo Alto, CA. I was in technology capital of the world. My life was about to change faster then I could have ever predicted. I would love to talk about what I am working on and probably don't have enough space to fill you in about it here but you can read about some of my adventures <a href="http://stuvoice.org/blog/2012/08/09/jack-hanford-recent-high-school-graduate-not-taking-traditional-college-route-california/">here</a>.

       <h3>Hobbies</h3>
       <p><strong>Biking</strong><br />
        One of my favorite things to do is bike. It's the only way I can keep myself in shape and living in beautiful California, I can almost always go. I have a favorite route that I like to take which is around 15 miles, I try to go atleast 3 times a week. The wonderful views and weather help me clear my head.</p>
        <p><strong>Programming</strong><br />
          This is something that is very unique, I love being able to think up an idea and than trying to bring it to life. I am still trying to master my skills and I still have along way to go. But being apart of a team that is shipping fast is something that I find very exciting.
          <p><strong>Mobile</strong><br />
            Everyone I have met has something that they are very passionate about, whether it be computers, surfing it could be anything. For me, that passion is the mobile space. I don't build mobile apps (except one) but I can't help myself from reading all of the news about the space countless times throughout. While I was in high school I would buy and sell smartphones on Craigslist. Although I was making profit, I was really only doing it to play with the latest hardware and software from Google, Microsoft and Apple.</p>
            <p><strong>Community</strong><br />
              This one is pretty obvious. I love hanging out with my friends. I live in a hacker house in Palo Alto with 14 other people. The age range is from 17-24. This has provided a really unique experience. We all have our own friend groups which overlap with our roomates. Our house always have things to do, whether its critiquing each others design, pulling all nighters programming together or yelling at each other while playing games - We are never bored.</p>
