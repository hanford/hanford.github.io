<h2>The Claco Team</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs once said "Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." This may be an extreme interpretation, but I think it captures the importance of our voice and standing up for what we believe in.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you a story about one of my best friends Eric Simons. You may have heard of him before, he is known as the AOL squatter ( http://cnet.co/JFwhkI ). He was your typical trouble maker, until his chemistry teacher dragged him into the hall and asked him, "What would make you interested in learning what I'm teaching?" He was stumped. She didn't ask him to try harder, she didn't ask him to stay after for help or study more - she asked him to figure out how she could grab his interest. No one had ever bothered to ask him that before. A few moments later, he replied, "let's get everyone working together on computers." He even volunteered to build the software for the class to use.</p>

<p>He is not only my friend, I now work for him. He is the reason I got a once in a lifetime opportunity - an internship across the country. Here is a link to my story ( http://bit.ly/NglJ1D ). My High School experience was terrible. I didn't give teachers a chance to teach me anything. Early on, I realized the education system was broken. I ask myself the same question on a daily basis: what if I went to school to learn, not for some arbitrary grade that is no longer important to me? School should be about learning, not passing classes. When I break the idea of school down to myself, I think of a building where children go to to learn about fascinating subjects like math and science. So how come the reality of school is different?</p>

<p>Recently I was at a education meet up for teachers. The presenter said "How do we fix the education system? The only kids who do homework are the kids who don't need to. If all of our kids turn a worksheet in, how do we know who actually did it and who cheated?" These questions stuck with me. Another teacher talked about lack of motivation, saying, "We have all of these subjects, take science. Science is happening everywhere.. all around us, and instead of showing kids why things happen the way they do, we hand them a black and white piece of paper.. A very exciting subject distributed in the most boring way possible."</p>

<p>This is where Claco comes in. Our team of 6, all of whom have different experiences with education, have come together to fix a very broken system. We have made a tool for teachers to build and share lessons online. Teachers can put their work on our website for other teachers to use, organizing their work in digital binders using a very powerful tagging system. Teachers throughout the world can now work together. Imagine learning about the Berlin wall using first hand accounts, pictures, or even talking to someone who saw the wall being torn down. The best part about what we are doing? It is all free.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning. By working with groups like NASA, instead of using dated textbooks, you can now see the latest news just by looking at their account. We are starting a revolution - all because one teacher asked the simple question "What would make you interested in learning what I'm teaching?" You can check us out at http://claco.com. Help us improve the way teachers teach.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> I originally posted this <a href="http://old.stuvoice.org/blog/2012/09/11/jack-hanford-from-claco-students-helping-improve-the-way-teachers-teach/#sthash.C5KulqFi.dpuf">here</a> and was soon after contacted by the moderators of the blog saying it was the by far the most popular article the blog had ever seen. Awesome! :)</p>
