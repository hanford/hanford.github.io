<h2>How Android is going to beat Fragmentation</h2>
<h6>OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer</h6>
<!-- First paragraph -->
<p>Earlier today, Google did <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera">something big</a>. On the surface it may seem minuscule, but I promise it isn't. What Google did was put their camera application on the play store for all android users to download and use. Is that all that they are going accomplish with this move? No, heres why..</p>

<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>When Google released the Nexus 5, they also released a new version of android 4.4 kitkat. When people started to receive the nexus 5 one of, if not the biggest complaint was universally about the camera. With one of the next versions of android 4.4.2, Google engineers had rewrote the entire camera app, improving the previous camera problems that a lot of nexus 5 users were having.</p>

<h4>The bigger picture</h4>
<p>One of android's biggest problems, as a platform is OS updates. Currently if Google pushes a new version of android, OEM's who make the smartphones (i.e. Motorola, HTC etc.) have to then upgrade the software they put on top of android in their smartphones (i.e. TouchWiz, HTC Sense, etc). This process isn't always short, but even when it is they then submit their update to Verizon or AT&T to verify that it works correctly on there network. If it isn't they then have to go back and make fixes, then submit it back for testing again.. This process has stopped a lot of android users from ever seeing device OS upgrades. For Apple to update the iPhone, they just have to push out the updated software to users. (That process is way smoother and that is how ~90%+ all iPhones are running the latest software, whereas only ~4% of android users are on the latest OS).</p>

<h4>Google's uh-oh</h4>
<p>When 4.4.2 was pushed, soon after a bug was uncovered. Some camera daemon wouldn't shut down properly. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/google-working-nexus-5-battery-drain-fix-affects-all-android-devices-kitkat-qualcomm-chips-1559771">Source..</a>This is a big problem because for this to be patched, google would have to halt all development for users who don't have kitkat yet, and give the OEM's a new version of android to build off of. This would mean newer devices with some of the latest hardware wouldn't see kitkat for potentially months.. This is why so many android users are on different operating systems.</p>

<h4>The solution</h4>
<p>What Google did today by putting their camera application on the play store will also help the fragmentation problem. If there is a bug in a application Google can quickly fix it and then push it to the play store without having carriers involved at all. What this also does is leaves room for the teams who work on google applications to release major product updates without them having to be binded to an android OS update.</p>

<h4>TL:dr</h4>
<p>Android Apps on the play store bypass a cumbersome update process also making room for major product releases not necessarily being binded to major OS releases.</p>
