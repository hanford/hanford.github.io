<h2>Android OEM's</h2>
<small>OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer</small>
<!-- First paragraph -->
<p>Android is one of the worlds most popular operating systems. Being open source it is really easy for anyone to just download the source and build it. This is why it is so popular and is dominating the smartphone marketplace. Hardware companies like <a href="http://www.lg.com/us">LG</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/smartphones/">HTC</a>, <a href="http://sony.com">Sony</a> and <a href="http://motorola.com">Motorola</a> don't need to write their own operating system or Appstore to compete in the smartphone market - they can just use android. By taking this route, you have access to Google services which is one of the best parts of android you get to use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store">Play store</a> which has over a million applications already on it.</p>

<p>Several companies have tried to offer their own operating system as competetion in the smartphone market, but have lost every time (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone_8">Windows phone 8</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_10">Blackberry 10</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeeGo">Meego</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen">Tizen</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian">Symbian</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch">Ubuntu touch</a>, the just list goes on and on). Have they really lost? Some definitely have, the others just can't seem to pick up any traction. Which brings this down to two core mobile operating systems - iOS and Android. Although there is two operating systems there is still a ton of competition because so many other companies are using Android.</p>

<h4>Why any of this matters</h4>
<p>This is where things start to get interesting. Of the five major android manufacturers I listed above, Samsung owns over 60% of the market share. They didn't adopt android <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream">first</a>, they don't really offer any unique features either.</p>

<p>So, why are they dominating? Marketing. Things won't be changing anytime soon either. LG is gaining <a href="http://www.technologytell.com/gadgets/141977/report-lg-fastest-growing-android-maker-us-today/">a little traction</a> But 7% is nothing compared to Samsungs ~65%. I recently purchased a LG Nexus 5 and have been tremendously surprised at the quality of the device. HTC is also very well known in the android community for a very premium build quality. For the last few years it hasn't even been clear if HTC is going to even be a company much <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/news/447491">longer</a>.</p>

<h4>What I think</h4>
<p>Right now is a really important time for android. They are toppling iOS's market share and Google isn't going to slow down anytime soon. For everyone except Samsung, mobile could be live or die for the company. One thing is sure, the next couple of years of android will be really interesting.</p>
